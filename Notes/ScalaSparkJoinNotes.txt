Join Syntax:

1) Basic

people.join(employees, "name")

2) Columns that don't match name or that require advanced conditions:

people.join(employees, people("name") === employees("salary"),"left_outer")

"<=>" means equility test that is safe for nulls unlike "==="

3) With any type of join specified you may need to wrap Seq() around the columns like so:

people_tbl_df.join(people_json_df, Seq("name"),"full_outer")
